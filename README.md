# Multi-Level-Feedback-Queue-Schedular
This is the project of Operating systems course in UST-ZC (CIE 301). In this project, implemented a multi-level feedback queue scheduler that have 2 queues. Processes in the first queue are scheduled using a round-robin scheduling algorithm and  processes in the second queue are scheduled using a First-Come-First-Serve scheduling algorithm.
